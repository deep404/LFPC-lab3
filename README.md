# LFPC-lab3
This is laboratory Nr.3 to the "LFPC" subject at university. The code converts Context Free Grammar to the Chomsky Normal Form

#### To find the CNF of CFG you should write your grammar in the grammar.txt file. There is already written an example. The grammar you write in the file must respect this form:
1. Write all terminal symbols, one per line
2. After you finish writing the terminal symbols write 'next'
3. Next write all nonterminal symbols, one per line
4. After you finish writing all nonterminal symbols write 'next'
5. Then write all the rules, one per line in the following form: "Symbol -> Symbols". Between arrow and symbols is one space.
6. The last line should be written 'next' and Enter
7. Save the grammar.txt

#### Example:
a
b
next
S
A
B
next
S -> aA
A -> bB
B -> ab
next

#### Every block in Main.
